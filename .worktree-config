# Git Worktree Configuration
# This file defines the structure and settings for git worktrees

# Worktree root directory (relative to repository root)
WORKTREE_ROOT="../worktrees"

# Default base branch for new worktrees
DEFAULT_BASE_BRANCH="main"

# Naming convention for worktrees
# Supported patterns:
# - feature/feature-name
# - bugfix/bug-description
# - hotfix/critical-fix
# - experiment/experiment-name
# - release/version-number

# Directory structure will be:
# examples/                    (main repository)
# ├── scripts/
# │   └── worktree.sh
# ├── .worktree-config
# └── ...

# worktrees/                   (worktree root)
# ├── feature/
# │   ├── new-api/            (feature/new-api branch)
# │   └── user-auth/          (feature/user-auth branch)
# ├── bugfix/
# │   └── login-issue/        (bugfix/login-issue branch)
# └── hotfix/

SHARED_FILES=(

# IDE/Editor specific settings
# VSCode: Each worktree should have its own .vscode/settings.json if needed
# IntelliJ: .idea/ folders are automatically separate per worktree
