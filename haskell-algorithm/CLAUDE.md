# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Running

- `ghc Main.hs -o main` - Compile the main program
- `./main` - Run the compiled program
- `runghc Main.hs` - Run the Haskell file directly without compiling

### Development Setup

- Uses GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) version 9.2.8
- No build system configuration (cabal/stack) - uses simple GHC compilation
- No test framework configured

## Architecture Overview

This is a simple Haskell algorithm examples repository with a minimal structure:

- `Main.hs` - Single entry point containing a basic "Hello world" program
- `README.md` - Empty documentation file

The repository appears to be set up for learning Haskell algorithms but currently only contains a simple starter program.
